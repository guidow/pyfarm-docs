Environment Variables
=====================
PyFarm has several environment variables which can be used to change the
operation at runtime.  For more information see the individual sections
below.

.. note::
    Not all environment variables defined below are directly used by
    PyFarm.  Many of these values are provided to make it easier to group
    settings together and so settings for PyFarm won't conflict with any
    existing software.


Database Schema
---------------
Environment variables that are used to setup or control the database backend.

.. warning::
    These values are used to construct the database schema.  If your schema
    already exists then changing these values may have uninteded consequences.


.. envvar:: PYFARM_DB_PREFIX

    The prefix for all table names.  Normally this should never be changed but
    could be for testing or similiar similiar circumstances.
    **NOTE**: making this value to long may produce errors in some databases
    such as MySQL

    The maximum length a hostname can be
    **Default**: 255

.. envvar:: PYFARM_DB_MAX_JOBTYPE_LENGTH

    The maximum length for the name of a jobtype.
    **Default**: 64

Database Constraints and Validation
-----------------------------------
Unlike the above section, these values are checked when a database entry is
modified or created.  They are intended to provide validation so erroneous
data cannot be inserted.  Do note however the **max** value any integer can
be raised to is 2147483647.

Job Type
--------
Environment variables that are used to read, configure, or run a job
type.

Agent Side
~~~~~~~~~~
Environment variables that serve to define default behaviors or values
for job types on the agent.

.. envvar:: PYFARM_JOBTYPE_ALLOW_CODE_EXECUTION_IN_MODULE_ROOT

    If ``True``, then function calls in the root of a job types's source code
    will result in an error when the work is assigned.  By default, this value

Database Side
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Environment variables that serve to define default values for a job type
object in the database.

.. envvar:: JOBTYPE_DEFAULT_MAX_BATCH

    Performs the same function as :envvar:`PYFARM_QUEUE_MAX_BATCH` but provides
    an override specifically for :attr:`pyfarm.models.jobtype.JobType.max_batch`

    Sets the default value for
    :attr:`pyfarm.models.jobtype.JobType.batch_contiguous`
